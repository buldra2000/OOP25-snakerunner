# OOP25-SnakeRunner

This game is an imitation of the game 'Snake Runner'. When the application is started, the menu will be show. You can choose:

- **Play:** Starts the game.
- **Option:** Shows checkbox for audio on/off.
- **Exit:** Closes the game.

The game consists of 4 levels:

- **Level 1** The player’s goal is to collect a minimum number of apples in order to access the next level. The apples are randomly distributed along the path, and the snake must move carefully to reach them.
- **Level 2** introduces walls as a new obstacle. Along the path, there are walls with small gaps that the snake must pass through to continue. In addition to the standard apple, which restores one life when collected after a loss, there are two special apples. One appears only for a limited time and, when collected, gives bonus points and temporarily slows down the snake, making movement easier. The other one increases the snake’s speed. The player must reach 10 points to complete the level.
- **Level 3** is based on choosing the correct keys and matching doors. In the top-right corner of the screen, a text indicator shows the color of the key that the player must collect and the color of the door to pass through in order to continue, while avoiding the obstacles placed along the path. The level must be completed without mistakes: collecting the wrong key or passing through the wrong door immediately restarts the level, forcing the player to repeat the entire sequence from the beginning, while hitting an obstacle causes the player to lose one life.
- **Level 4** the player must reach a final key that grants access to the last stage of the game. In this final section, the snake must navigate through walls, obstacles, and blocks. Along the path, there are bombs that instantly reset the player’s lives if hit, as well as other obstacles that increase the snake’s speed upon collision, making movement harder to control. To successfully complete the final level and win the game, the player must also collect a set of red orbs that appear in random positions during the level.
 
**Enjoy SnakeRunner!**
